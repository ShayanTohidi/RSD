abstract = {Both the expected-utility maximization and the hierarchy property are very important properties in stochastic dominance. For almost stochastic dominance, Leshno and Levy (2002) propose a definition and Tzeng et al. (2013) modified it to give another definition. This note provides more information on the two definitions. The former has the hierarchy property but not the expected-utility maximization, whereas the latter has the expected-utility maximization but not the hierarchy property.}

 abstract = {While "most" decision makers may prefer one uncertain prospect over another, stochastic dominance rules as well as other investment criteria, will not reveal this preference due to some extreme utility functions in the case of even a very small violation of these rules. Such strict rules relate to "all" utility functions in a given class including extreme ones which presumably rarely represents investors' preference. In this paper we establish almost stochastic dominance (ASD) rules which formally reveal a preference for "most" decision makers, but not for "all" of them. The ASD rules reveal that choices which probably conform with "most" decision makers also solve some debates, e.g., showing, as practitioners claim, an ASD preference for a higher proportion of stocks in the portfolio as the investment horizon increases, a conclusion which is not implied by the well-known stochastic dominance rules.},

abstract = { Leshno and Levy [Leshno M, Levy H (2002) Preferred by “all” and preferred by “most” decision makers: Almost stochastic dominance. Management Sci. 48(8):1074–1085] established almost stochastic dominance to reveal preferences for most rather than all decision makers with an increasing and concave utility function. In this paper, we first provide a counterexample to the main theorem of Leshno and Levy related to almost second-degree stochastic dominance. We then redefine this dominance condition and show that the newly defined almost second-degree stochastic dominance is the necessary and sufficient condition to rank distributions for all decision makers excluding the pathological concave preferences. We further extend our results to almost higher-degree stochastic dominance. This paper was accepted by Peter Wakker, decision analysis.}
